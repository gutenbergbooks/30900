prejudice and superstition, and help to install<br />

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>The most eloquent testimony given this
little book is the fact that a second edition
is made necessary only a few months after
the publication of the first edition.</p>

<p>Favorable comments and letters of recommendation
from men and women eminent
in literary and scientific realms, and commendatory
reviews in periodicals of high
standard are, I think, sufficient cause for the
belief that "The Tyranny of God" forms a
necessary cog in the machinery of intellectual
thought and progress.</p>

<p>Even those who bitterly oppose the book
admit that it possesses the power to make
its readers think.</p>

<p>Of the many opposing reviews and
adverse criticism of "The Tyranny of God,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
not a single one offers an argument in
answer to it. For the most part, their
characterization has been that it is "pessimistic."
As if by calling it "pessimistic,"
they refute its claims!</p>

<p>If to tell a man the true nature of a
disease from which he is suffering, with the
hope that he will seek a cure for his malady,
is pessimism, then I am a pessimist. Is the
use of a danger signal at a hazardous crossing,
for the purpose of preventing disaster,
pessimism?</p>

<p>If to literally "hold the mirror up to
Nature," disclosing Nature's utter disregard
for the life and feelings of man, as a warning
against the extravagant and useless propagating
of life, is pessimism, then surely I
am a pessimist.</p>

<p>If a fervent desire to help Man, instead of
wasting time in prayer to "God," is pessimism,
I am a pessimist.</p>

<p>If to think, to investigate, to express one's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>thoughts courageously in the face of centuries
old dogma is pessimism, then I must
confess I am a pessimist.</p>

<p>If to expose sham, hypocrisy and fraud;
if to open the mind and free it from fear;
if to stimulate the intellect, and work for
the Here instead of the "Hereafter"&mdash;if all
these are classified as pessimism, then truly
may I be called an arch pessimist.</p>

<p>"The Tyranny of God" was written to
express the truth as I see it&mdash;to portray life,
not as we would like to have it, but as it
actually is.</p>

<p>Millions are still like frightened children,
afraid of their own shadows. Fear of the
truth is the greatest deterrent to its
acceptance.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FOURTH_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FOURTH_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION</h2>


<p>I am indeed gratified to send forth the
fourth edition of "The Tyranny of God."</p>

<p>I wish, however, to say to the reader that
my book deals with life philosophically and
not individually. It was from the viewpoint
of life in general and the universe as
a whole that the sentiments herein were expressed.</p>

<p>To love God is not the duty of man and
one of the most important tasks to be accomplished
for the human race is to destroy
the Theistic conception of Life and the
Universe.</p>

<p>The sentiments I expressed at a memorial
meeting in honor of Luther Burbank last
May best illustrate my convictions. I said:</p>

<p>"The religious person loves God so vehemently
that he has no love left for Man."</p>

<p>May "The Tyranny of God" do much to
accomplish the purpose of its author.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
<i>Where did we come from?<br />
What are we doing here?<br />
Whither are we going?</i><br />
</p>


<p>These questions have puzzled thinking
people since consciousness first dawned in
the brain. Many have sought to answer
them, so why not I?&mdash;with the hope that
the reading of this book will arouse in the
minds of the readers thoughts that will enable
them to answer these questions for themselves.</p>

<p>Were you suddenly to find yourself living
on another planet, and you were a thinking
being, one anxious for knowledge, you would
naturally investigate the conditions under
which you found yourself, and seek, if possible,
a solution for your existence there.
Surely it is equally appropriate, situated as
we are on this earth, endowed with brains and
possessing senses and nerves, to inquire into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and investigate the conditions under which
we live, and the purpose, if any, of our existence
here.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this existence warrants
such analysis. It is certain, from our understanding
as well as from all visible scientific
facts, that we did not make ourselves, and
that we never had a former existence; and
we are led to conclude, in view of lack of
credible evidence to the contrary, from those
who have passed on, that the future, so far as
our individual life is concerned, is an eternal
void.</p>

<p>It is also certain, as science has indubitably
shown, that we do not make our offspring,
that we are not creators, but are instruments
merely in producing life.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we did not make any portion
of the globe which we inhabit and of
which we are a part, and, so far as we are
able to determine, all the natural conditions
and "raw materials" of our environment are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>something separate and distinct from anything
which we ourselves possess sufficient
power to accomplish.</p>

<p>Therefore, since among the organs of my
body, there is a <i>thinking</i> portion, I am within
the bounds of sanity when I investigate and
express such thoughts, opinions and findings
as my reason and understanding dictate. No
one can truthfully say that he possesses sufficient
knowledge to account for or to explain
the peculiar and mystifying rules, conditions
and surroundings which we are <i>forced</i> to accept,
abide by and live under. And, therefore,
the result of one person's findings is
worthy the same consideration as those of
another.</p>

<p>Upon such basis I submit an honest attempt
to express logically my convictions
upon this vital and puzzling condition of our
existence, and shall endeavor to aid those
who read this book to see conditions in what
I believe to be their true light, and to stimulate
the readers to think for themselves. It
is only through the exchange of the results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of investigations, and of honest opinions, that
we have been able to add improvement to improvement,
and make easier the routine of
our lives. The conditions and elements that
compose Nature, for the sake of clearness, I
will ofttimes call "God." I shall be more
easily understood, and at times the term
"God" will express more succinctly the
thoughts or ideas I wish to express.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p>Lest I be misunderstood, I will say
at the outset that I do not believe in
a God.</p>

<p>The belief in a God is still generally accepted,
not because of the existence of one,
but for the reason that it is the easiest way
to account for our condition. But in the
light of scientific discoveries and demonstrations,
such a belief is unfounded and utterly
untenable to-day. Yet the word "God,"
and even the word "Nature," must often be
used to describe that condition which the
brain of man has not yet been able to
analyze fully and scientifically. One ridiculous
conception of God that is believed by
a multitude of people, is that of a massive
being, sitting in a marble chamber studded
with gold and lighted with glistening crystals.
Do those who believe in such a creature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
ever consider him taking a bath&mdash;and in
what? Or of eating his breakfast&mdash;and of
what it consists?</p>

<p>If there were a God, and the world were
governed with stern justice, tempered to our
feeble intelligence, existence might become
tolerable, but as it is, with a so-called God
"ruling above," the earth is an abominable
place and life a long series of terrifying torments.
If I were to advocate a belief, or
faith, in a God, I would seek the embodiment
of those things diametrically opposite to the
attributes of the popular God of to-day.
Such a creature is not worthy the sacrifice of
ourselves and our thoughts.</p>

<p>Let us examine and investigate the system
and arrangement of the world&mdash;that is, that
portion of which we are a part and which so
vitally concerns us.</p>

<p>The result of our most extensive study and
labor shows us that the earth, after an illimitable
duration of time, has gradually attained
its present peculiar development. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
other words, Nature has taken millions of
years to produce the earth as it is now
formed; and if it were made particularly for
human beings it is not yet completed, for we
still find spots, aye, vast areas, where human
life is incapable of subsisting. The climate
is either too hot or too cold; there is too much
water or too little moisture; the means of
cultivation are too meager or utterly unobtainable.</p>

<p>In short, after eons of labor, Nature has
failed to be able to present to every one of
us, for our habitation, a parcel of earth commodious
and comfortable enough to be perfectly
desirable for life and its living.</p>

<p>Surely, if the earth were made for our benefit,
Nature has been not only a very poor
provider, but a very thoughtless parent.</p>

<p>Some say that man is Nature's best product,
that the earth was made for us, that we
are particularly selected by God, and that a
certain race is his chosen people. But that
is not true. The Jews are no more God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
chosen people than the jay is his chosen bird,
or the mosquito his chosen insect.</p>

<p>It is not true that Nature particularly
works for us&mdash;facts prove the contrary.</p>

<p>Facts prove that we are nothing but an
undesirable by-product, to make our way
and to live our life as best we can within a
cruelly turbulent space, imprisoned by invisible,
impenetrable walls of limitation.</p>

<p>No, it is not true that our life is favored
by Nature. After we build our homes, make
our cities and add improvements, what happens?
Nature, with her forceful winds,
blows them down; her cruel storms and rising
floods wash them away as so much refuse,
and a tremor of the earth destroys not only
our homes but ourselves also, leaving no
traces of our efforts, treasures and sacred
ties.</p>

<p>Even as individuals we "curse God" for
the shortcomings with which we are afflicted.
The exceedingly stout person, one who is "in
his own way" curses God for making him so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
stout. The thin person has a similar grievance.
Those who are too large and those
who are too small are equally dissatisfied.
The shape of an eye, the curve of the mouth,
a blemish here, an impediment there, is the
direct cause of poignant embarrassment.
Organs or dimensions too unsightly and unsatisfactory
are productive of continual
worry and torment throughout our lives.
The blind, the deaf, the dumb and the crippled
have forever a curse for God upon their
lips.</p>

<p>We inhabit the air, with a density of fifteen
pounds to the square inch, a mixture of
dirt and water, in the same manner that the
fish inhabits the water and the worm the
earth. Were we beings of a superior type,
Nature would have made us so versatile that
we should be able to accustom ourselves to
any condition, and survive in any climate.
But despite all our improvements, despite all
man's efforts to avoid and escape the conditions
of Nature, many of us freeze to death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in winter and become prostrate from the heat
of summer. If it were true that the earth
were purposely made and existing for us
there would be "no flowers born to blush unseen
and waste their sweetness on the desert
air."</p>

<p>We, ourselves, scientists tell us, are the result
of a long series of evolutionary development.
They tell us that Nature started with
a single cell of protoplasm, a single cell of
living organism, and produced the present
human species after the life and death of an
illimitable number of forms through the
stages of countless ages, not exempting those
lives from the fear, torture and misery that
are still so essential a part of the scheme of
life. Why impose so cruel and wasteful a
condition upon those numberless billions that
have lived before us, since nothing but eternal
death was gained by their existence?</p>

<p>Surely, Nature is a poor architect and
builder, after taking so much material and
so much time, to make such an incomplete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
place for such an outlandish form to rule and
occupy. If we were given the same opportunity
(that is, you and I), with all the
power and resources of Nature, to build a
habitable place, and mold a living something
to inhabit it, our results would be ten thousand
times better than that which circles the
scope and boundary of our lives, with the incomprehensible
physical form with which we
breathe and manifest life.</p>

<p>Truthfully, and without the slightest element
of egotism, I should be ashamed of my
efforts were I to present as my handiwork
nothing better than the level and plane which
Nature has attained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>


<p>We come into this world a tiny bundle
and mass of helpless, feeble flesh,
utterly unprepared to meet the requirements
and fearful conditions that lie in wait for us.
We are in need of immediate, urgent and
constant help from those who were responsible
for our birth, imperatively so from our
mother.</p>

<p>The child does not ask to come, and knows
absolutely nothing about its welfare. And
the mother often does not want to bear it, as
she knows absolutely nothing about maternal
cares. And yet that mother must go through
the "shadow of the valley of death" before
she can deliver this tiny bundle and helpless
mass of feeble flesh. And how often, aye,
only too often, does the mother <i>enter</i> the valley
of death when making delivery of this
living form, never to see the face of the child
that Nature imposed upon her to bear!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>What a despicable arrangement!</p>

<p>What an unfair bargain!</p>

<p>Can you imagine a more outlandish, ridiculous,
awkward, complicated, cruel and fearful
system of reproduction than that which
we are under yoke to pursue? Without the
elaborate details of the perilous stages of
life's development, this is the method of incubation
Nature imposes upon us. Before
the birth of a human being, one male and one
female&mdash;that is, one man and one woman&mdash;must
have sexual intercourse. Whether this
intercourse is prompted by all the finer impulses
of life or is accomplished by the savageness
of rape makes no difference to Nature's
purpose. To Nature the end justifies
the means, and she continues to go about her
business.</p>

<p>The male&mdash;that is, the man of this pair&mdash;can
strut and parade with the utmost
freedom from his responsibility for the
result of his act that Nature has made to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>pre-eminent among his desires. But the female&mdash;that
is, the woman of this pair&mdash;<i>must
for nine months</i> (just think of it!) carry and
develop the germ of this child in the fertile
field of her womb, and be subjected to the
innumerable terrifying dangers accompanying
such a carriage, and then suffer a superhuman
torture to make the delivery, through
a very meager channel of her body, of this
living plant which she has never seen, does
not know and quite often does not want, <i>but
must absolutely bear</i>!</p>

<p>Provided Nature has not made the creature
too deformed and mutilated and unable
to survive, the mother must, during a period
of constant care and <i>outward carriage</i>, bear
this feeble infant for another period of nine
months or more!&mdash;suckling at her breast for
<i>food</i>!</p>

<p>So you see that woman is not only a human
being, but a fertile ground and pasture.</p>

<p>I have not gone into the misery of child
bearing and caring, nor of the ingratitude
that is so often received. I ask for what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
reason has Nature imposed this terrible penalty
upon woman? <i>Why?</i></p>

<p>Would you, reader, were it in your power,
formulate such a method of reproduction?</p>

<p>I'll answer for you:</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>But that is not all. For years to come,
this child that for nine months was carried
inwardly and for a much longer period outwardly,
by its mother, must now be fed,
washed and clothed for an indefinite number
of <i>years</i>, and guided through a thousand
perils and dangers that Nature has set before
it, with disease as Nature's agent,
crouching and ready to destroy the child's
life, not in open combat, but invisibly concealed
by the limitation of our senses. This
is one of Nature's unspeakable crimes; one
of God's despicable impositions.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient that a mother should
subject herself to such a dangerous and perilous
mission, but she must also withstand the
cruel savageness, the cold, callous death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
piercings, of Nature's invisible tyrants and
destroyers. Life holds but one real attraction,
one instance that can be classified above
all others. Without this attraction it would
be a blessing to choke the life breath from us
all. With it we are helped to bear the
<i>Tyranny of God</i>.</p>

<p>There comes a time to some of us when
the heart of the one man beats for the one
woman, and there alights and resides in their
breasts that spark of devotion that we call
"love." When there is born to that union a
child, even though in Nature's stupid way,
then a bond is created more precious than
anything else in this world. Without this
little circle of loving joy, the earth is a prison
and life a grave injustice for those who must
bear it. But think of the damnable rule of
Nature that strives and delights in working
destruction of the only condition worthy of
life's living!</p>

<p>Oh, if only the life of our offspring were
more stable, more secure!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>If only the bosom of our family were guaranteed
to us! Just think! The child the
parents would not harm, Nature tortures and
God kills!</p>

<p>Looking back upon the path we have trodden,
with its continual fight against disease,
its manifold combats with obstacles of life,
and with its inevitable portion of sorrow we
all must bear, we should think seriously and
consider the result of our act before we deliberately
bring another human being into this
life.</p>

<p>You, yourself, do not consider your life
worthy of reliving, so why bring a human
being here to go through the same, if not
more, suffering and misery than you have
borne with no resultant good?</p>

<p>Up to this point I have been speaking of
human beings only, living under improved
conditions that man has made. What
must be the horror, darkness and emptiness
of those living substances that are "inferior"
to us? Do you know and realize the suffering
that we endure? Then let me, in passing,
urge this: Be also kind and considerate
to our less fortunate inhabitants of this
earth, the "dumb" animals. Their feelings
are quite similar to ours. They have gone
through the rougher parts of evolution that
gave to us our more useful organs and limbs.
They are allied to us in much the same manner
as the members of our own species. They
have their painful aches and periods, their
hardships and tortures, their broken family
ties and fearful abhorrence of death; their
flesh is tender and their skin is as delicate to
them as ours is to us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>So let us "think twice," dear readers, before
we deliberately harm any of our humbler
brothers and sisters that must inhabit this
cold and callous earth and live their lives
under a great deal more tyranny and injustice
than we live ours.</p>

<p>We deliberately enslave and brutally treat
the gentle horse.</p>

<p>We tyrannically imprison birds and fishes
as "pets."</p>

<p>We keep, breed, kill and eat a variety of
animals for our own selfish purposes, and yet
some persons still have the audacity to say
that we are "chosen people," "God's children,"
"divine beings." Bah!</p>

<p>You know what painful inconvenience
there is in losing an arm or a leg. Well, the
winged and footed beings that must bear this
life suffer a great deal more than we do when
one of their limbs becomes dismembered.</p>

<p>Man has to a degree remedied or replaced
his crippled limbs, but I do not think any
other of the higher animals have advanced so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
far, and as a result these creatures must endure
their pain and distressing annoyance to
the end.</p>

<p>Recently I watched a common house fly
caught upon "fly paper," and studied intently
every visible movement of it. Immediately
upon alighting upon the sticky substance,
its first thought, almost instantaneously,
was to make an effort to free itself.
At once I thought of the fly's instinct of
"self-preservation," and contrasted it with
the human's.</p>

<p>The fly must have had intelligence, since
it knew that its life was in danger. And,
since Nature does not deal in "fly paper,"
the fly's reasoning power told it of its peril.
With unabated determination it vibrated its
wings with lightning-like rapidity, and
worked its legs unceasingly, <i>breaking them
in the attempt</i>, in its efforts to pull itself
away to freedom!</p>

<p>As I watched this fly in its labor, this
thought came to me: Is the fly unlike the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
human being in its desire to live? Is it afraid
of death and of the mystery of dissolution?
Has it, too, all the agony of fear of passing
to the "Great Beyond"? Has it, too, an
imaginary God in the form of a Big Fly?
And is it also afraid of that God's supposed
wrath?</p>

<p>If the fly's desire to live is so great, what
interest does it have in life?</p>

<p>Does it love? Does it derive happiness
when it is able to labor to make happy its fly
Juliet?</p>

<p>Does it want to live because it is ambitious
and is trying to excel other flies?</p>

<p>Does it really think to better its species
and solve the problem of its kind?</p>

<p>Is there a fly family to mourn its death?</p>

<p>While watching that fly and asking myself
these questions, I was convinced of the following
<i>truths</i>:</p>

<p>That the force that we call life is the same
that animates the fly. That it, too, has control
of its muscles and nerves in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
proportion as we have control of ours. That
it, too, possesses the five senses and adds to
its tiny brain more intelligence through its
experiences. Within the movements and actions
of that fly was wrapped up the secret
of "Whence did I come, and whither am I
going?"</p>

<p>As I released my attention from that fly,
I muttered to myself: "The more I look at
insects, the more I think I am one."</p>

<p>For what purpose do <i>we</i> arise in the morning,
fill our stomachs with food, till the fields,
and perform labor in exchange for nourishment,
in the evening fall into a sleep from
exertion, arise the next day, and perform the
same routine, day in and day out, week in
and week out, year in and year out, and at
the age and in the heyday of physical development
seek an outlet in the opposite sex for
the strongest impulse that Nature has implanted
in us?</p>

<p>This impulse forces us to commit rape and
murder, robbery and assault, and to violate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
every principle of honor that man has tried
to establish for the betterment and advancement
of the race.</p>

<p>With the dissipation of this mighty sex
force, we subside and decline into weakness
and decay, only to pass into death and oblivion.</p>

<p>What a fearful, wasted effort is this life!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>


<p>The system of nourishment that Nature
has imposed upon the world is not only
stupid and malicious, but also of a cannibalistic
character.</p>

<p>We, as frail human beings, are horrified
and shocked to think that our ancestors trafficked
in and delighted in eating the flesh of
their race, and even to-day we are making a
strenuous effort to discourage the barbarous
custom of killing animals to eat their flesh,
yet it seems a dictate of Nature that forces
us to uphold that custom. Just think of it!
Nourishment and life-sustaining forces are
derived from eating the cooked flesh of a
dead animal, the unborn fowl, the bowels of
the lamb, and the eggs of the fish!</p>

<p>Can you imagine the wildness of life in
such a jungle of cannibalism? No wonder
the savage instinct is so deeply implanted in
us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>To get a fair idea of the food we eat to
sustain life and to please and satisfy our palates,
we need but take a casual glance at any
of our modern butcher shops. Although to-day
you will not see human limbs on display
and for sale, as they were years ago, you
will be impressed with the following morsels
put there to tempt your appetite: In
our modern butcher shops you will find pigs'
feet, calves' brains, ox tongues, breasts and
legs of lamb, chicken livers, dogs ground to
bits and sold as sausages, live and dead fish
of all kinds and varieties and innumerable
other portions of animal flesh.</p>

<p>Fortunately we have got beyond the point
where we eat the entrails of these animals,
although we use their hoofs to make glue,
their bones for powder, and we string our
delicate musical instruments with their vitals.</p>

<p>The things we consume, in turn consume
the living forms that they capture and subdue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p><p>The lion, the tiger and the leopard will devour
us more quickly, and with less ceremony
and with more delight, than we devour other
animals. We, being "civilized," boil the animal's
flesh and season it with weeds that
Nature allows to grow, to give it zest and
flavor, while our wilder brothers eat us in
the raw, natural manner, only removing our
civilized clothes.</p>

<p>Really, if getting nearer to God is getting
back to Nature, the beasts of the fields have
an advantage over us. And we know to-day
that even the living things in the vegetable
kingdom suffer alike from the fearful tortures
and penalties of the world. They follow
almost the identical routine of life that
we follow. Birth, life, reproduction, and
death are their lot as well as ours; so that,
if man were only to practice the idealism of
his cramped and feeble brain he would starve
to death!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>


<p>If the world is the result of an established
plan, as some say, it must be the conception
of a hideous monster whose three cardinal
principles are Disease, Despair and
Death. But this much we can say: Though
God created us a savage, fortunately man is
civilizing Nature's brute and is making him
a Man.</p>

<p>Disease is one of Nature's cardinal forces.
So, to attain health, we struggle against disease; but
health only means the guarding of
it through fear. "With all the ills the flesh
is heir to," true health is a chimera, an existing
state unknown to man.</p>

<p>To be "well" is such a precious condition,
that Nature cautions us against expecting to
retain health too long, by instructing us,
through experience, to prepare for a siege of
illness. Thus, disease and illness would seem
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>to be the natural states, and health the artificial
condition under which Nature permits
us to live. No one goes to his grave without
suffering the tortures of some disease and
paying the penalty of living. No one is exempt
from the inflictions Nature imposes.</p>

<p>The greater portion of our life consists in
devising means and medication to relieve us
of our states of ill health and disease. Sanitation
and all the methods we are capable of
discovering and inventing are becoming universally
applied to kill and to destroy the
menacing germs that God causes to inhabit
the air, and that breed and multiply in
the fertile flesh of our bodies.</p>

<p>And finally, we are so utterly ignorant of
how even to eat, sleep, walk, breathe, stand
or sit, that the slightest infringement of the
simplest rules of life can, and does, cause us
irreparable harm.</p>

<p>If we did not move to help ourselves, Nature
would have us live in filth and stagnation.</p>

<p>We seek, discover, or invent all kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
methods to build health and to remain perfectly
strong throughout our lives, and yet,
despite it all, we are puny and sickly beings.
In fact, I do not think there is such a thing
as perfect health. What we may do to correct,
insure or perfect our healthy tissues will
have a detrimental effect upon some other
part of our body. What we do to build up
must also tear down. What we do to produce
health will, after a certain point, produce disease.
This, it seems, is the law not only of
life, but also of the universe.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that God did not possess
the magnanimity of an Ingersoll and
make health contagious instead of disease.</p>

<p>Physical pain and mental suffering are the
mysterious sorrows that we must experience
and pay to a tyrant God for the existence we
bear. It is incontrovertible that no realization
is given us by Nature of the fearful
pains and tortures that we are capable of suffering
and still sustain ourselves, only to repeat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>over and over again the unending torment
in exchange for the consciousness of
a worthless life.</p>

<p>We, with our limited intellects, with our
puny strength, with our inability to utilize
all the materials in our possession, are still
superior to the workmanship and the justice
of God.</p>

<p>Tyrant is no name for such a God, who
creates a living organism purposely and maliciously
to torment and torture it.</p>

<p>A poor creature is a God who makes his
suffering playthings more powerful than
"he," and compels them to bear their existence
under the lash of inexorable laws of
sorrow and suffering, pain and penalty.</p>

<p>And yet we are satisfied with so little. We
ask for a crumb only. We are pleased with
the slightest favor. A toy delights us; a
little trinket elicits from us warm gratitude;
a breath of balmy air is drunken with keen
and pleasurable delight; a "fine" day is celebrated
with exultation!</p>

<p>But what a mockery is life!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>We writhe in pain and bear the brunt of
an arrogant tyranny from whatever force
that created and controls us. We must daily
bathe our bodies, wash our hair, brush our
teeth, change our clothes and perform other
necessary physical functions to feel freedom
from the filthy conditions that Nature imposes
upon us and surrounds us with.</p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us eyes, she
should have given us perfect ones; not those
which, upon the slightest contact with a
minute foreign substance, cause unutterable
pain and possible loss of sight, in a world
where sight is so imperative!</p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us ears, she
should have given us perfect ones; not those
which are capable of such frightful pain, with
the possibility of becoming totally deaf, when
it is so necessary to hear!</p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us a nose, she
should have given us a perfect one; not one
that causes such miserable torture and unbearable
suffering from the slightest defect!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us a mouth, she
should have given us a perfect one; one that
would perform all the functions of perfect
speech; not one that is so liable to harm and
so susceptible to dumbness, when speech is of
such paramount importance to Life!</p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us teeth, she
should have given us perfect ones; not those
which ache and pain with such fearful intensity
that the mind is almost distracted!</p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us arms, legs, and
organs, she should have given us perfect ones;
not a body whose tenderness makes it an instrument
of such menacing torture; not a
body of crippled bones and crippled joints,
where suffering results from everything it
does!</p>

<p>If Nature saw fit to give us a brain, she
should have given us one strong enough to
withstand all the rebuffs of life, and one capable
enough to utilize all the forces under
command. Each person should be a mental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Hercules capable of solving his own problems
and directing all matter to its greatest
material uses.</p>

<p>Instead of the human body being the marvelously
constructed instrument we are wont
to believe it, we now find it to be nothing but
a common machine, imperfectly made, and
subject to innumerable changes and radical
improvements.</p>

<p>Every person acquainted with the anatomy
of the body can give you a list of imperative
improvements that it needs, and without
which it will continue to function imperfectly
and continue to cause pain and suffering to
its possessor.</p>

<p>It were a great deal better, after a full
summary of life, were we to be created
utterly devoid of feeling, equally impervious
to joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain. We
should be manifestly benefited, for the
greater part of our life is now full of sorrow,
anxiety, fear, pain, disappointment and
worry.</p>

<p>A small portion of our life is a matter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
indifference. A portion might be termed
satisfaction, and a minute balance, an infinitesimal
part, termed&mdash;if there is such a
thing in life&mdash;joy.</p>

<p>And yet, the joy we may experience to-day
will not be present to-morrow to cheer
and comfort us, but the pain that we feel
to-day will pinch us more strongly to-morrow,
and will remain as an ever-poignant
memory.</p>

<p>Joy and pleasure are of a transitory nature
only, while pain and sorrow are of a permanent
and accumulative character. Is <i>all</i> of
life worth the sorrow, the agony and fear
of death?</p>

<p>Just think of giving a life so full of grief
that those who have it do not want it and
quite often destroy it! No wonder that
drugs more powerful than our minds, used
to numb the pains of life, are so much in
demand and so universally used.</p>

<p>What a ridiculous assumption it is to think
that a soul, separate and distinct from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
body, would imprison itself in such a miserable
confinement!</p>

<p>Instead of life's being a privilege, it is a
prison, wherein we must suffer fearful pains
and still more fearful thoughts. Physical
pain registers a high degree of intense feverish
suffering, but mental torture is fired with
the scorch of hell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Human life is the cheapest thing that
God makes! No consideration is
given to the feelings, pains and sorrows it
must bear and endure.</p>

<p>No wonder that ridicule, shame, hatred
and other forms of mental suffering cannot
be withstood by some frail minds, and cause
them to seek relief from their torment.</p>

<p>Under the red-hot brand of mental torture,
the jealous husband sees his wife violate
every rule and principle and vow of virtue.
He sees her reveling in the arms and embrace
of him that he despises, committing trespass

the mettle of the man is best tested by such
adverse forces, and some of the most inspiring
moments of life lie in overcoming these
conditions and triumphing over unjust, undue
and seemingly impossible odds. What
I do mean is, when life no longer holds any
attraction, when the ravages of disease have
torn and mutilated your body, when pain
and torture are raking your mind, and your
daily companions are these miseries, with no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>

<p>The child suffers the sharpest pains, the
crudest poignancy that could possibly
be inflicted upon its body, through the
stupid, frightening and monstrous tales that
are continually told to it to make it "good,"
to make it "obey."</p>

<p>To think that a child cannot bear to enter
the dark, cannot bear to be alone, cannot bear
to be separated from its loving and protecting
parents, and yet must suffer in a few
moments from a fatal disease&mdash;the agony of
all this, in the face of death, is the crime of
crimes, too damnable and horrible for words.</p>

<p>I remember once seeing a little lost child.
It cried for its mother. Hot tears were
streaming down its burning cheeks. Its face
portrayed the severest form of suffering that
life is capable of experiencing. If Nature
ever made a frail article, it is our tender offspring,
so bewildered, so utterly helpless, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
agonizingly delusioned, so pitifully searching
for some familiar face; something to make it
discover its lost self. Oh, what power ever
made us so tender, so incapable of self-help,
as to have us undergo and feel such terrific
suffering! It is injustice enough when
adults are made to suffer mental and physical
ills, without inflicting such a painful
decree upon mere infants.</p>

<p>At least an adult has some conception of
his suffering. He can make provision for
some remedy. He can seek others to ask
them to render help. He knows, he feels,
he understands the situation, and can adjust
himself as best he can to obtain some relief.</p>

<p>But not so with the child. Its mind is not
capable of comprehending the condition
which makes its suffering so sharp. Its little
brain is too feeble, hardly strong enough to
direct its awkward and bulky body, much
less to solve such an incredible predicament
as being utterly destitute of help, in a world
fashioned upon such an unsatisfactory plan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>There is not, nor can there be, a sadder,
more distressing sight, than to see a little lost
child overcome with fright.</p>

<p>If it were in my power to abolish any of
Nature's cruel laws, I would take from the
little child its feeling of pain.</p>

<p>Let me ask, would man, were it in his
power, send a helpless creature, utterly unable
to sustain itself, without power of
thought, understanding or expression, so dependent
upon loving care, kindness, help and
comprehension, into a world that is a wilderness,
a world reeking with pestilence and
populated with shrieking beasts and brutal
and savage people?</p>

<p>As a passing word regarding the child,
let me say this:</p>

<p>Do not judge your child as an ordinary
mechanical instrument, as if he could be
wound up to a certain degree and gradually,
as if by clockwork, tick away each moment
of the day. The child is a combustible force,
and, although there are certain rules by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
which you may obtain the greatest degree
of improvement, you cannot rigidly adhere
to them. There are numberless instances
when the propensity or inclination of the
child may appear to you to be aggravating
and annoying; nevertheless, you must not
let <i>your</i> irritability interfere with the development
of that trait pre&euml;minent to the child's
character.</p>

<p>Look upon your child, encourage your
boy or girl, to be a pioneer and a soldier
in the march of progress. Instruct it
with the knowledge of the miserable conditions
of our past history, and bring it forcibly
to understand that efforts only are repaid,
and that we must work in order to accomplish.</p>

<p>Prayers are only wasted words on the
desert air. The greatest mental crime ever
committed is that of teaching a child, "while
still upon its mother's knee," its duty and
obedience to God. It would appear that
for the amount of suffering it must endure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and in the face of its unconsulted coming,
we should at least disregard God for his insolence,
and impress upon the child the
peculiar conditions of life. We should instruct
it, that from time immemorial, Nature
has been laboring through the most awkward
process of reproduction, and has finally
brought the child into existence, not to enjoy
the benefits, or eat of the fruits of the earth,
but to bear a life of continual strife and suffering.
Not of God should we speak to our
child, but of the importance of being prepared
to do all in its power to help others
to escape the torture, misery and hardships
it must so painfully overcome. Is it any
wonder that we grow up to be serfs and
slaves? Before we are able to know or understand
the very rudest fundamentals of
life, our entire mental machinery is corrupted
by unshakable fears and dedicated
to the vilest and most sickening submission.
Would that we were left alone, and free to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>follow the thoughts of our own minds, regarding
the great problems of life. What
a mighty, unhampered power we would possess
to find the proper course of action, and
possibly the real solution to the mystery of
the <i>Tyranny of God</i>!</p>

<p>To love and to reverence our tormentor is
repulsive and despicable, and since we refuse
to allow man to tyrannize over man,
what degradation it is for the human race
to cringe and bow down unconditionally to
the imagination in the great realm of uncertainty!</p>

<p>Do not hurt your child. Do not strike it.
Do not cause it any unnecessary pain. Before
it is able to walk, before it is able to
talk, before it is old enough to tell of its
pain and suffering, Nature makes it endure
enough.</p>

<p>Remember, the only language of the babe
is the cry of pain.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself under the lash of suffering,
utterly speechless and incapable of conveying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>your wants and feelings to an absolutely
strange surrounding, and you will
have a slight picture of the growing child in
your household. Did you ever stop to consider
that the child, when born, does not
know that you are its parent? It does not
know that you are its father, or that you
are its mother. It does not know what
prompted its birth, or why it must live&mdash;and
above all, what it has done to be sent to
such a miserable prison place as the planet
upon which we live. We must demonstrate
all this as well as we can to the child.</p>

<p>This much we can be sure of: kindness,
tenderness and love should forever be our
guide in our dealings and contact with
children.</p>

<p>The child is brought into this world from
the insuppressible passion of two people, and
surely without its consent, and it is absolute
tyranny and barbarity to torment its mind
or to punish its body, regardless of the result
its action may have upon us.</p>

<p>To the little children that have suffered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
horrible punishment so generally followed in
that cruel and false book&mdash;the Bible&mdash;my
heart goes out in pity, since words fail me to
describe those savage characters that visit inhuman,
tormenting and torturous treatment
upon their unwelcome offspring.</p>

<p>If we were forced to perform the thousand
tyrannies that are directed against the child
during the day by cruel and thoughtless
parents, the lunatic asylum would soon be
our place of refuge. Such trivial things as
a spot on the shoe, a speck of dirt upon the
clothes, a mere tip of the hat, a slight turn
of the scarf often give rise to such violent
reprimand, and very often brutal punishment,
that the savageness of barbarians is
mild compared to such displays of temper.</p>

<p>My heart again goes out to you, little children,
when and wherever you are, that must
bear the brunt of brutal actions from stupid
and thoughtless parents and guardians.
These people seem to classify children in the
matter of discipline as grown ups, thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
(or, rather, not thinking) that children's undeveloped
minds should be as strong as theirs,
when they themselves are unable to practice
the self-denial that they expect from mere
infants.</p>

<p>How often does a child receive a slap in
the face from a parent for the asking of only
a simple question, when the parent is not in
the "humor" to "bother" with him?</p>

<p>What a painful and terrifying beating
does a child often get for disobeying some
arbitrary command uttered by the one over
him. To the child, "Don't do this," "Don't
go there," "Stand up straight," and "Say
this" are commands that carry with them
court martial and its severe and unrelenting
punishment.</p>

<p>Remember this: The child will respond to
kindness and love more readily and directly
than to force and unwarranted discipline.
It is purely a question of whether your feelings
are actuated by these impulses.</p>

<p>If you have become mentally strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
enough to restrain your impulses to strike
your child, do not substitute other means to
"punish" him. Changing the method of
brutally inflicting physical pain upon your
child to some other means, though less repulsive,
is still obnoxious and harmful.</p>

<p>If you are unable to convince your child,
by persuasion, example or otherwise, that
you are right and that the child should follow
your instruction, then by all means, let
it become the victor in the contest.</p>

<p>Fear&mdash;fear of pain, fear in every form&mdash;controls
our lives, and shapes the courses of
our puny destinies.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>


<p>The mind, through fear of death, is
capable of suffering, within a few
moments, the tortures of an eternity, although
to accomplish death, Nature may require
only a few minutes. The extent of
the mind's capability for suffering is beyond
compare.</p>

<p>Nature has been distinctly conspicuous in
imbuing us not only with grave doubts
and uncertainties, but also with an unshakable
fear regarding death. In the deepest
moments of despair, when living has
absolutely no attraction and life becomes a
burden and a menace, we fight desperately,
and without abatement, for this narrow,
worthless thread of existence.</p>

<p>Possibly the fear that we have in the face
of death is caused by the fact that we must
suffer pain before death is accomplished.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>And a great deal of the theory of "self-preservation"
is due merely to our great
horror of pain.</p>

<p>The indisputable fact that thousands
"take their lives" by choosing the least possible
painful method demonstrates, with a
firm conviction, my thought that it is the
avoidance of pain, rather than the retaining
of life, that prompts our efforts to live.</p>

<p>It is only too true, and heard from the lips
of thousands, that if they "could only lie
down and never awake, what a blessing it
would be." We speak in terms of "having
lived too long," "being tired of living," "life
not worth living," etc., as if life were a prison
sentence, and, often, rather than continue the
servitude, we surmount and overcome the
deterrent of pain and destroy the life.</p>

<p>Very often our desire to keep on living is
prompted by our baser impulses. We "live"
sometimes to "get even" with someone&mdash;to
spite someone. We "live" sometimes to be
able to "show" what we can or cannot do.
Were it not for these baser impulses, what an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
unlimited number of people would refuse to
continue this monotonous, painful and non-paying
life!</p>

<p>The foregoing expressions of life, at one
time or another, represent the feelings of all
humanity. In the United States alone during
the year 1920 it has been conservatively
estimated that more than twelve thousand
persons committed suicide. These persons
were engaged in all kinds of pursuits and
came from <span class="smcap">ALL</span> walks of life. They ranged
from social outcasts to society leaders; from
poverty stricken unfortunates to persons of
great wealth; from illiterate men and women
to editors and college professors; from laborers
and layman to physicians and ministers.
The youngest suicide was a mere infant of
five years, the oldest, a centenarian of 106!
Among the suicides of last year were two
evangelists and twelve clergymen. It would
appear that those who had devoted their
thoughts and services to God would at least
be spared the agony of such suffering as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
force them to prefer death and to take their
lives. I say with Ingersoll, it is a wonder
God does not at least protect his friends and
defenders.</p>

<p>The reluctance we have to die is due in a
large degree to the possibility of securing
a few more moments of joy from an already
too much troubled world, with the hope that
a little compensation will be derived from
the pain and sorrow we have endured.</p>

<p>And yet those things that we may live to
enjoy to-day and to-morrow may likewise be
present to thrill us at some future date, away
and beyond the limitation we are capable of
surviving. It is from this desire that we unconsciously
"feel" that we would like to
"live" always, to get our full measure of
return; and since such is neither the lot nor
the privilege of our possession, it really
makes no difference when we die as far as
personal satisfaction is concerned.</p>

<p>The fear that possesses us now in the matter
of death will likewise and with equal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
force possess us later, when we actually and
without ceremony must submit to the inevitable.</p>

<p>The desire that possesses a person to live
now will, with equal attraction, obsess him
later.</p>

<p>Our desires and aspirations are never satisfied.
What we may cherish to accomplish
to-day may be consummated and achieved,
yet to-morrow another something will demand
our energies to be spent for further
desires to be accomplished.</p>

<p>When we are babies we desire to walk;
when we walk, we desire to talk; when we
talk, we desire to grow; after we grow, we
want to learn; after we learn, we want to
do and to expand&mdash;and our performance and
expansion are only curtailed by insolent
death!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>


<p>The only justification there is to live,
once conscious of the damnable scheme
of life, is the burning desire to do something
to help mankind bear the conditions and to
make easier the burden of life for those who
are here and for those who are to come;
for very often the greatest benefactors of
the race are so maligned and persecuted in
their day that only the future can render
a just appreciation of their labor and their
value.</p>

<p>For without the improvement bestowed
on life by the world's benefactors, over the
crudity of Nature, it were better that we
remain in the bosom of our wilder brothers,
and hang from the trees by the length
and the strength of our tails. Aye, back
and back and back, down every degree
of life until the time before the first cell of
protoplasm from an inanimate into an animate
state started.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Why must we be made to suffer such
dreadful torment before death, since by eternal
decree it is the common lot all must
endure?</p>

<p>Death, puzzling, eternal death, is Nature's
final stamp upon our fearful struggle
through life.</p>

<p>And the agony of death is more poignantly
mental than physical, since the mind, reviewing
the acts of the past, anticipates with
anxiety and with picturesque vividness the
wrongs, scandals, terrors, fears and injustice
of the future.</p>

<p>Since life is so replete with physical pains,
no wonder our picture of death is so horrible.</p>

<p>We see upon the lifeless form the cast of
its agonizing pain, and augur from that an
eternity of sorrow. But fortunately, in reality
we can only feel pain as long as we
possess "life." In a sense, therefore, death
is a blessing.</p>

<p>After all, the severest pains of death lie in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>the brains of the living. The mind is capable
of suffering in one moment all that a
lifetime can repay with pleasure, and no joy
is sufficient in value to compensate you for
enduring an irreparable loss.</p>

<p>The conditions that existed before our
birth are identical with the conditions that
will exist at our death. As we knew no life
and felt no pain before our birth, we shall
know no life and feel no pain after our
death.</p>

<p>Death is no longer the enigma of life.
Living is its problem. The sting of death
has been removed. We know death's destiny,
and no longer fear its consequences.
The only suffering attached to death now
is the injustice of its time of coming, the
reluctance of parting with loved ones, and
the loss of the opportunity to attain. Well
might I say with Shakespeare, that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cowards die many times before their death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The valiant never taste of death but once.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems to me most strange that men should fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing that death, a necessary end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will come when it will come."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The most despicable characters of human
life are those who prey upon credulous persons
when in the face of death and shrouded
with the fear of its uncertainty, picturing to
those persons horrible and frightening tales
of an eternity of torture.</p>

<p>What unspeakable misery must those
whose religious conviction has so terrified
death and its aftermath, especially when
it is intensified and horrified through the
mouthpiece of ignorant priests, suffer in consequence
of death.</p>

<p>Oh, what a fearful sting must be there!</p>

<p>Just think what this poor, vast, credulous
multitude pay, with the sweat of their brows
and the bend of their backs, to enrich these
moral beasts in exchange for their ignorant
and terrifying mumblings, that rob the deluded
ones of every fiber of courage and
every thought of perfect peace and rest.</p>

<p>It is while living that death possesses its
sting and anguish. Anyone that seeks tribute
from the dying, or from the living for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
services on behalf of the dead, is a damnable
moral scoundrel and a cunning rascal.</p>

<p>To those whose minds have been poisoned
from childhood with this religious conviction,
this most awful of beliefs, I cry: "Throw
off these tyrants of the mind. Emancipate
yourselves from this fearful ignorance and
mental bondage!" What a burden will be
lifted from their lives and what a glorious
freedom they will experience!</p>

<p>If we are to die, let us die in perfect calmness
and in perfect peace. Let us become
firmly convinced that, once we are dead, no
thought, no act, can possibly harm us. We
are beyond the pale of Nature's pangs. We,
the individuals that we were, are free from
everything. We are at rest, and forever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>But after this life with all our pains
and sorrows, what then? What is there
to repay us for living?</p>

<p>I answer:</p>

<p><i>Nothing!</i></p>

<p>I have no misgivings about the "future."
I am firmly convinced that there is no "after
life," that when we "breathe our last" we
arrive at our eternity. We are "one with
yesterday's seven thousand years." We are
like the flower which, "once blown, forever
dies."</p>

<p>I firmly believe that life as now manifested
in our bodies is a combustible force identical
with that of any other form of life. No less
so than the "seed" of the flower is different
from the "germ" of the wheat.</p>

<p>Both are forces!</p>

<p>So are we!</p>

<p>They may be different manifestations, but
fundamentally they are the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, the very force that manifests itself
in a mechanical instrument made by man is
the identical substance that rules the organs,
and charges the brain of our being. In the
same manner that the force dissipates itself
in the mechanical instrument made by man,
and no longer gives motion to its parts, so
the force that animates our being dissipates
itself and is no longer capable of giving motion
to our parts and organs.</p>

<p>As man's instruments are dependent upon
many channels for their complete performance,
so the human brain and body have their
many dependencies that must fully and
properly be nourished to maintain their
power.</p>

<p>Each day science draws another veil from
the mystery of life.</p>

<p>Our eye is but a chemical camera, that
we have not only reproduced, but even improved
upon.</p>

<p>Our voice is nothing but a vibration, that
we have not only reproduced and improved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
upon, but whose minutest modulations we
have recorded in innumerable duplications.</p>

<p>Our ear is but a drum, that carries and
conveys to the brain the vibrations of our
voice, and that function we have reproduced
and even improved upon by the instrument
we call the telephone.</p>

<p>The telegraphic system of the human body
that communicates to the brain the conditions
that the senses perceive, is no other than
that which man has even improved upon by
the transmission of an intelligible message
to a far-distant land without the use of any
apparent conductor. With the marvelous
instrument, the telephone, man sends his
voice around the world.</p>

<p>Man's greatest inventions, the phonograph,
the camera and the telephone, both
wire and wireless, make the work of Nature,
as manifested in our bodies, a simple, childish
affair, fit only for the kindergarten of
things.</p>

<p>When Edison invented the incandescent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
light and reproduced the human voice in the
phonograph he pulled aside the veil of secrecy
and penetrated the infinite.</p>

<p><i>He proved and demonstrated man to be
greater than God.</i></p>

<p>Our limbs carry our bodies in the direction
our brains dictate, and <i>that</i> function
we have reproduced and even improved
upon in all the means of locomotion that we
daily use and which we now consider as a
"matter of fact" among the ordinary things
of life. "Comparisons are odious" when we
compare the awkward motion of Nature
with the rapid locomotion of man.</p>

<p>Man progresses far too rapidly for the accommodation
of Nature, and as a result
adapts for his use and benefit vital essentials
that Nature in her laziness has either failed
to utilize, or will not utilize.</p>

<p>Although we have not yet completely discovered
all the material and mechanical
elements that compose life, we are sure and
certain of their origin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>We hear ourselves talk; we decide upon
our destination and direct our motion; we
eat when we are hungry; sleep when we are
tired; cry when we are in pain; and laugh
when we are tickled. Our whole being from
start to finish is mechanical, and the element
of something "spiritual," something separate
and distinct from a purely material sense,
is absolutely illogical and ill-founded in view
of the illimitable illustrations that are being
demonstrated every day.</p>

<p>It is a thing easily understood, if we
logically, and intelligently, without blindness,
preference or prejudice, analyze the
problem.</p>

<p>It may sound better and more desirable
to say that we possess a "soul"&mdash;that this
life is but a "stepping stone to a higher
plane"&mdash;but it is not true.</p>

<p>We cannot observe the true, actual facts
of life by coloring our subject. If we want
to determine the <i>truth</i> we must be mentally
prepared to accept the <i>truth</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>A painted face, brightened eyes, blackened
eyelids, Marcelled hair, and a form draped
in all the splendor of the finest silks do not
make a woman possess the sweetness and
charm that all this "dope" is intended to
make us believe.</p>

<p>As much as man wants to have the end of
this life attain certain benefits and destinations,
this desire does not make them real.</p>

<p>The implicit confidence in a faithless wife
does not make her loyal and virtuous. A
wife's confidence in a profligate husband
does not make him stanch and true.</p>

<p>Life calls for a cold analysis. It must be
stripped of all its artificial colorings and
superfluities. It must be measured and
weighed for what it actually is, not for what
we would like it to be. It must be determined
in the unwavering scales of science.</p>

<p>The proper study of mankind is not the
man in the white starched collar, with
trimmed hair, shaven face and polished shoes,
but the man recently from the forest, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
coarse, grizzly hair upon his back, brutal
and violent passion dominating his body,
and savageness and hatred in his startled and
terrifying eyes.</p>

<p>The sooner we come to the realization of
this vital fact, the sooner we become acquainted
with the basic origin of life, the
sooner we shall understand life, with its
achievements, with its aspirations and hopes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an absolute fact and certainty, impossible
of refutation, that when animation
ceases in the body and no effort is made
to revive it, life ceases and the processes of
decay and decomposition set in.</p>

<p>Yet it is permanently established and has
been successfully demonstrated innumerable
times, that certain methods of artificial
stimulation have revivified and resuscitated
the delicate organs that cause the heartbeat
and give consciousness to the brain.</p>

<p>Recently my local newspaper contained
the following item:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"DEAD" BUT SAW NO SPIRITS</p>

<p><i>Oklahoma City, Okla.</i>, February 7th&mdash;Neal Dillingham
doesn't believe in after-death communication
with the living. Dillingham was "dead" for twenty
minutes recently, and he says he ought to know.</p>

<p>Doctors said Dillingham's blood circulation was
stopped by a clot of blood. His heart stopped beating,
and he did not breathe.</p>

<p>Insertion of a saline solution into his artery just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>above the heart caused the clot to dissolve, and
Dillingham came back to life.</p>

<p>"I did not return to earth after I left it," said
Dillingham. "I had no knowledge of anything that
took place, but I must have been pretty dead, as I
do know I didn't recognize several persons I had
known all my life, after I was myself again. If I
had any talks with anybody while I was 'dead' I
don't remember anything about them."</p></div>

<p>Believing that the publicity that this case
received would make the party known to the
postal authorities, I sat down and wrote him
a letter, hoping that, if fortunate enough to
have a letter delivered to him, he might be
kind enough to write me personally of his
experience.</p>

<p>After a lapse of several days I received
from him a letter substantiating in detail all
that was mentioned in the newspaper clipping
quoted above.</p>

<p>In the instance of this man Dillingham,
he was "dead," so to speak, and as far as his
"soul" was concerned it had "left" the body;
yet the injection of a material solution, compounded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>by man, in conjunction with artificial
respiration, caused the beating of the
heart and gave back to the brain its power
of consciousness.</p>

<p>If it is the "soul" that causes the functioning
of the body, where is it when such an
action takes place?</p>

<p>If it is the "soul" that gives us "life,"
how is it that we can materially and mechanically
destroy it?</p>

<p>We are born and nourished by material
means.</p>

<p>We live our life by material means.</p>

<p>We reproduce our kind by material means.</p>

<p>And we can destroy ourselves by material
means.</p>

<p>Everything that touches and concerns our
life is purely material, and it should be incumbent
upon those who believe in the
"Soul" or the "Spiritual Element" of man to
produce the proof of their contention.</p>

<p>We are nothing but a continual propagating
instrument, without spiritual, moral, lasting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>or ultimate value. We are here to reproduce
our kind and for nothing more.
What man secures for himself within the
narrow circle of his existence here is all that
he gains for the life that Nature forces him
to live.</p>

<p>Everything man has, man has made.
Nothing has been given to him by Nature.
God has been a miser!</p>

<p>If man possessed a "soul" the thousand
deformities of the brain would not exist. Insanity
would be impossible, and all the forms
of petty vices that so miserably afflict us
would be totally unknown.</p>

<p>That which gives us the power of life is
a combination of the material forces of Nature,
and the elements that compose the
brain are of a chemical substance. The difference
between a "live" person and a "dead"
one can be summarized by a great many
instances about us, and because of their commonplaceness,
we do not observe them.</p>

<p>There are many apples falling to the
ground, but we are not inspired with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
knowledge that the actuating force is gravity.</p>

<p>One of the best illustrations, to show the
difference between a "live" and a "dead"
person, can be had from that excellent invention
called the "film" or "plate," and
which is so remarkably used in the camera.</p>

<p>When that sensitive composition of chemicals
that forms the "film" and which produces
such a vivid and lasting likeness of
ourselves is freshly made, it possesses that
vital something we call "life."</p>

<p>But allow this film to remain unused for
a period of time, and it will no longer be
able to perform its remarkable work. It will
not possess the "life" to take a picture or to
record an impression.</p>

<p>If a premature "exposure" of the film is
made, it loses its vital quality because of the
mixture with other elements, or because of
the evaporation of its constituent parts.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to analyze all the properties
of that film to show the principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
whereby it performs its wonderful work.
The general principle, showing its marvelous
use while intact and its utter uselessness
when its composition is no longer the same,
should be sufficient to illustrate the comparison.</p>

<p>This illustration can with force and conviction
be applied to the peculiar quality and
nature of our "soul" and brain. As long
as the brain is incased within our skull, and
fully protected from contact with any other
substance to alter or to change its integrity,
it will perform all that is warranted of it.
In the case of our brain, though, besides the
importance of keeping it protected from outside
chemical action, the vital element concerned
in its continuity of life lies in the
importance of keeping it constantly nourished
and supplied with the remarkable qualities
of the vital substance of blood.</p>

<p>The moment the blood supply to the brain
is stopped, our brain loses its most important
constituent, with the ultimate and inevitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
result of inertia, decomposition and decay.
When this condition happens we are then
"dead" and, like the proverbial egg, "all the
King's horses and all the King's men cannot
put Humpty Dumpty together again."</p>

<p>If we possessed a soul, and it were of a
permanent and special quality, it would
maintain its impressions and remember its
existence.</p>

<p>It could pass through innumerable periods
and know its many and varied journeys.</p>

<p>Even memory, so unreliable in our short
life, bespeaks the utter impossibility of such
a thing as a soul with a permanent and lasting
existence.</p>

<p>That which we call the "soul" is nothing
but a chemical composition, that can and <i>does</i>
lose its permanency while we are still alive.</p>

<p>We are acquainted with a number of
chemical compositions that must remain in a
pacific state to maintain their identity, so
those chemical forces that compose our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
"soul" must perforce maintain their equilibrium.</p>

<p>If we are stunned, or suffer any of the
many conditions that upset chemical compounds
and compositions, we, for the time
being, suffer either "unconsciousness" or
some other form of mental disability.</p>

<p>If we are shocked too severely, we become
totally and permanently impaired, and suffer
violent fits and fearful rages, insanity or
imbecility.</p>

<p>Different shocks, and even forms of disease,
result in certain action upon our chemical
brain, which causes it to lose only part
of its ability. Extreme high fever is only
one form of illness which causes the brain
to lose its stability and run rampant and
unbridled.</p>

<p>If I were fully cognizant of all forms and
degrees of disease, I could recite exactly how
they act and in what degree they harm the
delicate organism of our brain. In many instances
shocks or diseases too powerful for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
our brain to withstand, cause that portion
of our brain that may control our speech,
our sight, our hearing, our limbs or other
organs to lose its power, with the consequence
that we must suffer and be handicapped
with what is properly called "a great
affliction."</p>

<p>Science to-day has discovered that great
truth, and has not only catalogued the different
portions of the brain in their individual
departments or capacities, but, by a master
stroke of surgery, can correct and remedy
those impaired parts, and give back to the
human being the use of those valuable organs
that the invisible agents of Nature had
taken away.</p>

<p>So, instead of the brain's possessing a
"soul," we find it, only in a more delicate
degree, a mechanical formation such as we
discovered our body to be.</p>

<p>But if we possess a soul and it is capable
of passing through the many and varied
stages that life suffers, what becomes of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
impressions? What and where are the benefits
of its retention?</p>

<p>Where is the soul when we are in a state
of unconsciousness? Surely, if the soul were
ever present to guard and maintain life, it
would be standing by and using its power
when it is most needed. We have no occasion
for help when we are not in danger. It is
when power can be used and exercised that
it should be manifested.</p>

<p>Even love, the great compelling force of
our life, is subject to the variations of our
chemical "soul," its attractions and repulsions.</p>

<p>If two form the unit of reproduction, and
love is the great mating medium of Nature,
then once it is animated, once it is brought
into existence, it should endure permanently,
and the possessors should at least enjoy their
blissful companionship until the end. But
no. Nature would entice, and then destroy,
this most consuming feeling of life.</p>

<p>Two persons can start life with the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
irresistible attraction and irrepressible love
and within a very short time, unless they
guard their love with every means and
weapon of advanced thought and reason,
Nature, through her duplicity, will provide
searching eyes to alienate their affection,
causing a wretchedness unparalleled in the
mental miseries of mankind's life.</p>

<p>The saddest state of all is when two persons,
with the sacred devotion of love, cohabit
and the happy result is loving children, and
yet while this happy family, free from
Nature's pitfalls and snares, are living in a
peaceful and blissful state, there exists the
ever-menacing "devil" who tempts the loving
wife and mother to follow the will-o'-the-wisp&mdash;and
thereby undoes and destroys the
greatest kingdom of life.</p>

<p>The devoted husband and father, by the
flash of an eye, and the charm of a face, can
forsake his sacred ties of devotion and become
a degenerate and outcast, with death as
his only salvation. In either case Nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
stands by with a sneer upon her lips, and
God forgets his obligation to his children.
But the final analysis proves beyond doubt
that the physical attraction is responsible for
this action; and who can deny that it is the
chemical attraction of two forces that produced
this irresistible desire?</p>

<p>If the life we live be a kindergarten or
infancy of a larger and better life somewhere
else, Nature defeats her own ends,
because myriads pass on, leave here, with the
most dwarfed intellects, utterly unprepared
to live here, and much less prepared to
live in a higher state and on a more lofty
plane.</p>

<p>Were such a condition true, that this is
but a transitory existence, we should all have
to go through the same schooling of life, and
be indelibly impressed with its lesson, with
conviction and understanding that the same
mistakes would never be repeated, or the acquired
knowledge would be constantly and
forever used.</p>

<p>There would be no deaths in infancy, as
each child born would be purposely sent
here; neither would there be premature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
deaths, as no one could leave without "learning
his lesson."</p>

<p>There would be a fixed standard of knowledge
and development that we would be required
to attain. Knowledge, or whatever
condition Nature imposed, would be our
destiny, and we would devote our entire life
to its acquirement.</p>

<p>As it is, we bend our efforts and use our
strength to avoid and to escape the acquisition
of knowledge.</p>

<p>If our life were given to us in order to
pass through a school of experience, the simplest
truths would immediately manifest
themselves to our minds, and conviction
would be instant and permanent.</p>

<p>But how sadly untrue is this premise!</p>

<p>For thousands, aye, for millions of years,
the people have been stupefied with the most
ignorant and foolish superstition. An instance
that will present with great force an
illustration of the utter folly of the contention
that we are living on this planet as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
lesson in school, lies in the fact that for thousands
of years people not only believed but
religiously guarded the belief that the earth
was flat.</p>

<p>Even to-day, with irrefutable demonstrations
of the truth, there are some people who
either cannot, or will not, accept it.</p>

<p>As desirable as this theory of a transitory
state may be, it is even contrary to Nature
herself. The entire scheme of Nature seems
to be fashioned upon the same principle as
our life. The fearful struggle of the elements
involved squares identically with our own
existence. Even the gigantic constellations,
flying with an incalculable velocity, leaving
destruction and desolation in their tracks,
meet in their ignorant and blind journey the
same fate as we meet. Recent astronomical
discoveries speak of a struggle constantly
taking place in those areas.</p>

<p>The belief of an existence after death is so
untenable in the face of many scientific discoveries
of to-day, and of the irrefutable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
facts that are constantly staring us in the
face, that an instance or two are all that are
necessary to prove the fallacy of such a
belief.</p>

<p>Under many circumstances we are unable
to recognize our own blood relations after a
lapse of a certain length of time. Parents
fail to know their children; and children their
parents. This is equally true in every comparison
and degree of relationship. Features
and characteristics undergo such a decided
change and transformation that recognition
is ofttimes even impossible. Even the law
courts are continually called upon to determine
the proper identity of persons, to establish
the ownership of property by other means
than by personal identification. Most remarkable
of all, under new conditions, we do
not recognize ourselves within the interval of
only a few seconds!</p>

<p>Try this if you would seek proof, and convince
yourself that recognition of your own
personality is momentarily impossible, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
that you must resort to other senses than that
of sight to identify yourself.</p>

<p>Put a wig upon your head, blacken your
face, "make up" your features, and when you
have finished and are completely unaware of
your changed appearance, look into the mirror
for your reflection and feel the sensation
of the startling fact that you know not yourself.</p>

<p>We speak of changes so radical in a person's
appearance that we often say we could
not recognize him "in a thousand years."</p>

<p>What a ridiculous presumption it is, then,
to maintain that we live after death when <i>all</i>
senses are gone and perception is dead!</p>

<p>Again, how anyone can say that when we
die we go to "heaven" is too childish to consider,
because when we die, instead of going
up and to heaven, we are put deep into the
ground to moulder and to rot away.</p>

<p>What a far-fetched conclusion it is to assume
that we live after death, minus all the
physical characteristics and under conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
utterly incomprehensible to our minds!
Even if, at death, the body turned into invisible
gases it would mean and prove absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>If we live after death, by what means can
one person communicate with another?</p>

<p>We cannot feel, because we have no hands.</p>

<p>We cannot see, because we have no eyes.</p>

<p>We cannot smell, because we have no nose.</p>

<p>We cannot hear, because we have no ears.</p>

<p>We cannot taste, because we have no
mouth, no stomach.</p>

<p>But, with it all, these five mediums of sense
are dependent upon a <i>living brain</i>.</p>

<p>The fact that we suffer the loss of our
senses even before death, because of the complications
in the make-up of our body, should
be sufficient proof of the nonexistence of a
soul and the utter impossibility of a life after
death.</p>

<p>Unless we retain and maintain our sacred
ties after death, another life is valueless and
void, useless and unnecessary. It is a fearful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sadness to think that the ones you love are to
pass away into nothingness and be no
more; that the sparkling eyes will be
dim forever; that the rosy cheeks will no
longer glow with radiant health; that the
ruby lips will fade into a deathly blue, motionless
and forever still; that dimpled hands
and loving arms will never encircle you
again, and the supremacy and tenderness of
your love must be crushed with a cold and
callous ferocity.</p>

<p>But, sad and mournful as it is, with the
human heart beating hopelessly against hope
for only one more chance to kiss and caress
and love the one you so dearly cherish, it is
nevertheless only too poignantly true that
death ends all.</p>

<p>Death means nothing to the affairs of the
world.</p>

<p>To be taken from amid the world in such
an ever-living condition as now exists, is like
taking a cup of water from an ever-full pail.
The gap is immediately filled, and the level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of the water simultaneously adjusted, leaving
absolutely no trace of what has been
withdrawn. Only the individual suffers.
What a mighty burst of heart there would
be if we all could feel and suffer at the same
time!</p>

<p>Nature makes no difference and knows no
distinction between the living and the dead.
The warm and tender rays of the sun, and its
blistering heat, fall alike upon the crying,
innocent babe and the lifeless, unfeeling
corpse.</p>

<p>The sun does not shine to give us its necessary
heat, without also bringing to light some
new problem and pain for our over-troubled
hearts to bear.</p>

<p>Murder, rape and greed look no different
to Nature than goodness, virtue and unselfishness.</p>

<p>Tears were made for the things that God
causes, laughter is the result of man's efforts.</p>

<p>It is man's labor, man's work, man's
achievement, that gives us the little desire
that we have to live. How often do we
prefer <i>death</i> to living life in our former condition,
after our efforts have brought us to a
point of vantage and comfort!</p>

<p>Death is always preferable to the living of
a "dog's life!" And yet, with it all, the little
improvement we have to-day, with the still
remaining cruel conditions of Nature left to
endure and fight, has not been worth the
struggle through the black and bleak past.
The price has been entirely too severe for the
little that has been gained.</p>

<p>God gives man nothing; man gives man
everything!</p>

<p>What sublime courage it was that made
the pathfinders of the past sacrifice their
lives, in order that their principles of truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
might triumph, so that another link might be
made in the chain of progress that is endeavoring
to break the spell of a tyrant power.</p>

<p>You must be made to know that for whatever
desirable condition we have to-day we
are indebted to heroic men and women of the
past, who, in the days of infant progress,
achieved a moral, physical and intellectual
triumph.</p>

<p>The chair you sit on, the cup you drink
from, the fork you eat with, the light you
read by, the bed you sleep in, the heat that
warms you, the shoes on your feet, the clothes
upon your back, the hat upon your head, and
every part and particle of improvement that
has enriched the world with a little touch of
human comfort are the result of the heroic
labors of the men and women of the past,
who victoriously fought the accursed and
chaotic forces of Nature, so as to make life
and living a little better.</p>

<p>But at every step and stage of progress
the dogmatists have exerted their influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
toward retardation. What these dogmatists
were unable to accomplish through fear and
suppression, they accomplished through ostracism,
and death. Human advancement and
progress are foreign to the "believing" mind.
The dogmatists are concerned only with the
"supernatural." They want not the comforts
of life here if they can secure those
benefits "hereafter."</p>

<p>It is the attitude of the religious to belittle
anything that is designed for human betterment.
Their philosophy is, the more you
suffer here, the less you will suffer "hereafter."
Their humility to and fear of this
"unseen" power is the most degrading trait
in human beings. It is a frame of mind not
only despicable and a hindrance in the face of
progress, but even antagonistic to and destructive
of all things worth while.</p>

<p>To them, the insanity of belief is of paramount
importance, and is more sacred and
holy than human life. Aye, human life has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>been so subordinated to this superstitious belief
that it meant death in the past to those
who rejected it.</p>

<p>Rather observe some "holy day" than perform
"work" to help some fellow human being
in distress. Murder, rather than eat
meat on a "forbidden day"! This frame of
mind is one of the mental mysteries that
science has yet to solve.</p>

<p>The rotundity of the earth was discussed
and its circumference scientifically
measured hundreds of years before the supposed
birth of Christ, and had not the "God
believers" been so persistent in forcing their
belief upon others, and had not Christianity
been born, I can see how the discovery of
America would have been accomplished

Religion, that was madly trampling
upon everything of value, destroyed the famous
Alexandrian Library wherein was kept
a model of this engine. It also swept away
the incalculable wealth of knowledge that
had required ages to accumulate, and thereby
completely annihilated the most priceless
possessions that the human race ever owned.</p>

<p>But that is not all; it is only a fragment.
For history at every stage of life shows the
continual strife between the forces of progress

<p>What is that strange form of insanity that
prompts people to torture and to destroy
those who seek to emancipate them from the
<i>Tyranny of God</i> and from the deluded belief
in a hereafter?</p>

<p>The attitude of all, each and every one of
us, should ever be the desire and willingness
to greet a new idea, to support a new
thought, to try a new proposal, to do all in
our power to uphold the forces of progress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to lend our help and to devote our energies
in any direction that will ultimately lead us
from the cruel forces and narrow limitations
that are our lot to share.</p>

<p>To those who have no thought for these
things, who care not what forces and conditions
man must face, who take without
thought and give only through compulsion,
whose self-satisfied condition (made possible
only by the heroic work of the martyrs of
progress) make of them personal heroes,
whose life is wrapped within the flicker of a
day, who do not know, do not realize, and do
not care about the fearful suffering of the
world&mdash;I say to them to strut their intoxicated
hour and pass away. The sooner they
live their lives and the sooner they die, the
better for the earth. It needs fertilization.</p>

<p>Were we as mentally progressive as we are
materially advanced, what a wonderful and
magnificent improvement over the present
living conditions we would be enjoying!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Every new invention, every new improvement,
would be immediately and universally
installed, and every old and antiquated instrument
and method would be discarded and
destroyed. That which now seems only
within the command of the households of the
immensely wealthy, would be as popularly
used and enjoyed as the now commonly used
articles in the poorest households.</p>

percentage of dwellings for human beings
where there is not found the essential bathtub,

benefit, and shame upon such a government,
in an enlightened age like to-day, that
tolerates such a condition, when that government
possesses the men, the means, the intellect
and the materials to electrify the world!</p>

development is the comfort and conveniences
in a home.</p>

<p>These are some of the conditions that the
progressive minds of the world are trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
solve and remedy. It is only a question of
how much longer the majority of people will

<p>It is the antagonism of the dogmatic world,

cause of the mental progress of the world's
not keeping pace with the material progress.</p>

<p>Better still, the universal application of

of the universal acceptance of mental
achievement. The automobile, the gigantic
ocean liner, the talking machine, the electric

humanity.</p>

<p>The unselfish endeavors of man have made
it possible to take the dumb matter of earth

several generations may hear and know, with
a touch of human affection, the traits, features

Language gives us their thoughts, the camera
gives us their natural, life-like features and
the phonograph their actual, living voices!</p>

<p>Nature never did so much. As far as
Nature is concerned, bastardy may rule the
world!</p>

<p>One of the comforts of life is that we live
again in actions and scenes, which, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
they are apart from our own lives, really belong
to the past or future races. But Nature
sees to it that the births and deaths, the
knowledge and acquaintance of each and
every generation, are so closely allied that
none of us is allowed to escape the suffering
of the world and the agony of life and death.
No person can avoid the pain and the terrible
fear that all must endure.</p>

<p>No one person can live, move about and
possess the varied improvements of the
earth's materials all by himself. He is indebted
to others for their accomplishments,
and they in turn are indebted to him for the
improvements he renders. In short, we are
all so closely allied with the actions and lives
of one another that there should be a mutual
appreciation and a common understanding
among all.</p>

<p>The farmer may know nothing about
manufacturing; the manufacturer may know
nothing about farming; the artist, the explorer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>the thinker, the inventor and the scientist
may know nothing about any field of
endeavor other than his own, yet all are inter-dependent.</p>

<p>With such a condition existing, and with
the uncertainty of life forever staring us in
the face, and <i>no one exempt</i> from its terrible
enactment, it is a <i>marvelous</i> wonder to me
why there exist so tenaciously in the human
heart all the petty and aggravating tempers,
prejudices and jealousies.</p>

<p>What man has done with the forces of Nature
are inspiring deeds. What progress has
been made in opposing the forces of Nature
is marvelous. What man will accomplish in
the future with the arrogant forces of Nature
stimulates our hearts with the sweet satisfaction
of a victory of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>But in the final analysis, what does it avail
us?</p>

<p>Geologists tell us that the greater portion
of the materials that we have taken from the
field of Nature consists of the buried bones
and bodies of our ancient ancestors, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
passed through greater periods of agony, torment,
disease and death than we are finally
and eventually to meet!</p>

<p>What sort of crust in the earth's formation
are we to make? What will be the product
of the future living forces that will utilize the
materials that our bodies will make? What
will be the future living forces?</p>

<p>It is fearfully sad to contemplate that life
must continue and be subject to the miserable
laws that now govern it.</p>

<p>Insect man, with his almost tireless industry,
makes clothes to cover his ugly and awkward
body; builds houses to shelter him from
the winds and the torrents of Nature; fashions
glittering palaces of amusement to cheer
his troubled heart; compounds an&aelig;sthetics
to ease his pain; carves wood to replace his
broken limbs; molds metal to take the place
of those things that Nature has made inadequate
for his use. In short, man has improved
upon Nature to uphold his frail body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to strengthen his weak bones, and to soothe
his tender heart.</p>

<p>That man, fighting the forces of Nature,
has been able to accomplish so much is simply
glorious, and this progress is an achievement
of such wonderful magnitude that we are
thrilled at the thought, and bow in grateful
recognition for the benefits derived and the
relief enjoyed.</p>

<p>But why did not God institute all the benefits
for the immediate use of man, so they
could be enjoyed upon the first manifestation
of his understanding?</p>

<p>Why was it necessary to go through the
fearful period of past history and gain, only
after a most gigantic struggle, the few things
that we now use for our comfort?</p>

<p>That these things could have been done is
proved by the fact that man has done them.
Fundamentally they always existed. Man
has only discovered and applied them. And
these things that we have gained to-day, from
the struggles of the past, would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
equally enjoyed by those who lived before
us, with the same degree of benefit, just as
the future will find, use and enjoy those
things that we do not possess, and without
which we shall be pinched, and pained,
through the helter-skelter of this troublesome
life.</p>

<p>I brand as brutal tyranny this scheme of
life, that forces us to be a link in a long
series of lives to produce something for the
benefit of the far-distant future, that we,
ourselves, imperatively need but shall not
possess.</p>

<p>I cry and denounce and plead, in behalf of
future humanity, to circumvent and to defeat
this "sorry scheme of life," that uses us as an
instrument to produce something that we
cannot use, do not know about and have not
the understanding to comprehend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"In God We Trust," on coins that
represent our labor and our endeavor,
is an insult to the intelligence, courage and
independence of the people, and a stinging
rebuke to those responsible for our progress.</p>

<p>A motto that more truthfully represents
our material progress and intellectual development
would be: "In Science We Trust;"
or, "Humanity and Justice Our Aim."</p>

<p>The more we eliminate God from us, the
more we are <i>one without him</i>, the better for
us all, the better for humanity, the better for
all the world. The less we "know" of God,
the less God that is "in us," the more <i>human</i>
we become.</p>

<p>The greatest, most frightful and destructive
wars of all time have been those which
were started in "defense" of God, as if "he"
cared what man says or does.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The most frightful and torturous instruments
ever conceived by man are those that
were made to force people to "believe in"
God.</p>

<p>The history of religious persecution and
torture is the horror of the world.</p>

<p>May I ask, where was God, and what did
he do, to stop this frightful nightmare of torture
committed in "his" name?</p>

<p>And may I answer for you, that he was
where Moses was when the light went out?</p>

<p>Remember this: There will never be a
solution to any of our fundamental problems,
and mankind will never, in the full
sense of the word, be free, as long as there
exists in the human mind the insanity of
religious belief. As long as God occupies
a portion of our thoughts, mankind must
be content to suffer the hatred and antagonism
of man.</p>

<p>Let us make up our minds now, let us resolve
now, to stop fighting one another, and
fight God by helping one another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us stop fighting our fellow prisoners
and fellow sufferers, and fight God.</p>

<p>Let us help our fellow prisoners and fellow
sufferers.</p>

<p>Let us cleanse our minds of this superstitious
poison of an "after life," and work and
labor for the good and welfare of Here and
Now.</p>

<p>We possess the knowledge and the means
and, within the span of only one day, could
bring about the much-longed-for "Brotherhood
of Man."</p>

<p>We could eliminate hatred from our
hearts, and instill Justice as our guide. We
could eradicate poverty from our midst and
bring happiness to sorrowing mankind. We
could blot out tyranny among men and exchange
it for the priceless legacy of freedom
and make the relation between man and man
bear some semblance of humanity.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and I say this with redoubled conviction,
and with all the power, force, energy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>and vehemence that I possess&mdash;if we are Nature's
best endeavor, if man is Nature's best
product, if the Natural world is incapable of
any improvement, and life will forever be
made to submit to the tyrannical conditions
of Nature, then it were better ten thousand
times over, that life were never called into
existence, and that the universe were null
and void!</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;
</p>

<p>I received your book&mdash;"The Tyranny of God"&mdash;and
have read it through. I think as you do that death ends
all, yet I do not feel certain, because there are many facts
that seem to show that the real units of life are not the
animal mechanism itself, but groups of millions of small entities
living in the visible cells. The animal being their
mechanism for navigating the environment, and when the
mechanism fails to function, i.e. die, the groups go out
into space to go thru another cycle. The entities are each
highly organized and perform their allotted task. If there
is anything like this we still have a fighting chance. You
have doubtless read interviews I have given lately on this
subject. They appeared in the Scientific Monthly for October
30, 1920 and the Cosmopolitan for May, 1920.</p>
